ROADMAP

this is the roadmap that we (bukka/rspadim) talked in email:

1) complex numbers "helpers"
	that's a feature that we "need", and php don't have, maybe we will create a 
	complex solution to php-fftw, but since it's not a engeneer or scientific 
	language, probably they (php developers) only will accept as a ext, instead 
	of a standard lib, that what i think, but i could be wrong :), in this case 
	probably they prefer R/scilab/mathlab or other engeneer/statistic/math language

	with php-fftw we only need:

	1.1) a php object to create complex numbers and 'send/receive' to/from fftw lib
	something like 
	$complex->real, $complex->im, or an array? 
	$complex[0] = real, $complex[1] = im? 
	that's how fftw_complex save values (http://www.fftw.org/fftw3_doc/Complex-One_002dDimensional-DFTs.html#Complex-One_002dDimensional-DFTs)
	"The data is an array of type fftw_complex, which is by default a double[2] 
	composed of the real (in[i][0]) and imaginary (in[i][1]) parts of a complex number. "

	1.2) rectangular complex number to polar complex number (with this we can 
	get phase and magnitude)
	must check if phase will use radian or degree, maybe two functions (since 
	it's faster execute C code than PHP rad2deg deg2rad code)

	1.3) polar complex number to rectangular complex number (with this we can get 
	back from phase and magnitude and execute a inverse fft after a possible 
	frequency (phase/mag) change)
	must check if phase will use radian or degree, maybe two functions (same 
	problem of 1.2)

	1.4) squared magnitude function to execute square(magnitude[i]) in each 
	magnitude[] element, this will help spectral density applications

2) plans (create/destroy) 
	must check the fftw_cleanup function and fftw_destroy_plan (issue #9)

3) 1d fft/dft, from real to complex, complex to complex

4/5) export/import wisdom (plans)
	maybe this will be used at clone() fftw_plan object

6) 2d / 3d fft/dft
	here is something very important, 2d fft is used with images,
	here we should check if we could implement just one function or not (issue #8)

7) guru api?

8) full complex math? maybe other php-complex ext
	including add/sub/mul/div/mod/real/imaginary/pow and others functions, more ideas here:

	8.1)http://www.phpclasses.org/package/6193-PHP-Compute-the-Fast-Fourier-Transform-of-sampled-data.html#view_files
	8.2)http://perldoc.perl.org/Math/Complex.html		(perl complex numbers, interesting...)
	8.3)http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number
	8.4)http://pear.php.net/package/Math_Complex		(nice php pear math lib)

99999) nfft? i think too much for now, but it 's an interesting project, 
	maybe others libs? ffts and others?
